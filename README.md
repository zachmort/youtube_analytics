Have you ever wonderd what was the most popuar or most liked video of your favorte youtuber? Well I have! 
I analyzed one of my most watched channels to get more insight into how well thier video performance.

Questions I had going into this project:
- How has channel growth trended over time?
- What is the most watched video?
- What is correlation between likes, views, comments, duration in seconds.
- What is the distribution of likes/views ratio per video?
